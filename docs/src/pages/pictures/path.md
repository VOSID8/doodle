# Paths

## Concept

Paths are a way to construct complex shapes,
implemented by the @:api(doodle.algebra.Path) algebra and the @:api(doodle.core.OpenPath) @:api(doodle.core.ClosedPath) types. 
A path specifies how to control a virtual pen to draw a line. 
There are three different commands that a path can contain:

- straight lines;
- [bezier curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve); and
- straight line movement that doesn't draw to the screen.

Here's an example of a path. Notice that it has examples of all of the different components above.

```scala mdoc:silent
import doodle.core.*
import doodle.java2d.*
import doodle.syntax.all.*

val feather =
  ClosedPath.empty
    .lineTo(100, 100)
    .curveTo(90, 75, 90, 25, 10, 10)
    .moveTo(100, 100)
    .curveTo(75, 90, 25, 90, 10, 10)
    .path
```

Drawing this path creates the output below.

@:image(basic-path.png) {
  alt = A feather shape
  title = A feather shape
}

You probably noticed this is a `ClosedPath`, which suggests there is also an `OpenPath`. This is correct. The difference is how the path ends. If a `ClosedPath` doesn't end at the point it started (which is the origin), it will have a straight line inserted joining the end to the start. An `OpenPath` will not.

Here's an example showing the difference. We create a curve, drawn as an open and a closed path. Notice how the open path is just a curve, while the closed path has an extra line added joining the start and end points.

```scala mdoc:silent
val open =
  OpenPath.empty.curveTo(90, 0, 100, 10, 50, 50).path.strokeColor(Color.red)

val closed =
  ClosedPath.empty.curveTo(90, 0, 100, 10, 50, 50).path.strokeColor(Color.blue)

val curves = open.beside(closed)
```

@:image(open-closed-paths.png) {
  alt = A curve drawn as an open and a closed path
  title = A curve drawn as an open and a closed path
}


## Implementation

@:api(doodle.core.ClosedPath) and @:api(doodle.core.OpenPath) are both part of `doodle.core`, and not tied to either algebras or `Image`.

You can create a path by calling the `empty` method on either `ClosedPath` or `OpenPath`, and then calling methods on the resulting object. This is the approach used above. You can also creates instances of @:api(doodle.core.PathElement) and create a path from a `List[PathElement]`.

To convert a path to a `Picture` you can use the `path` syntax method, which is demonstrated in the examples above, or use the `path` method on the `Picture` object.

To create an `Image` from a path, use the `path` method on `Image`. Here's an example.

```scala mdoc:silent
import doodle.image.*

val openPath = OpenPath.empty.lineTo(100, 100)

val closedPath = ClosedPath.empty.lineTo(100, 100)

val path1 = Image.path(openPath)
val path2 = Image.path(closedPath)
```

## Utilities

There are several utilities to create common shapes. These are available as both `Picture` and `Image` constructors.

* `equilateralTriangle(width)` creates an equilateral triangle with the given side length.
* `regularPolygon(sides, radius)` creates a regular polygon with the given number of sides and radius. 
* `star(points, outerRadius, innerRadius)` creates a star with the given number of points. The points extend as far as `outerRadius` and go in to `innerRadius`. 
* `rightArrow(width, height)` creates an arrow points to the right with the given width and height.
* `roundedRectangle(width, height, radius)` creates a rectangle of the given width and height, with rounded corners with size given by `radius`.

These, and other methods, also exist on `OpenPath` and `ClosedPath`.
You can also create these paths as a `List[PathElement]` by calling the methods on @:api(doodle.core.PathElement).

There is also `interpolatingSpline`, which creates a curve that intersects a given sequence of points. Here's an example.

```scala mdoc:silent
val points =
  for (x <- 0.to(360)) yield Point(x, x.degrees.sin * 100)

val curve = Picture.interpolatingSpline(points.toList)
```

@:image(curve.png) {
  alt = A curve that intersects a sequence of points
  title = A curve that intersects a sequence of points
}
