# Shapes

## Concept

Constructing simple geometric shapes is provided by the @:api(doodle.algebra.Shape) algebra. All the methods on the algebra are constructors, so typically you'd access them by calling methods on the `Picture` object. Here's an example.

```scala mdoc:silent
import doodle.core.*
import doodle.java2d.*
import doodle.syntax.all.*

val basicShapes =
  Picture
    .circle(200)
    .strokeColor(Color.blue)
    .on(Picture.square(125).strokeColor(Color.darkBlue))
    .on(Picture.triangle(100, 100).strokeColor(Color.crimson))
    .strokeWidth(5.0)
```

This program gives the output below.

@:image(basic-shapes.png) {
  alt = A red triangle inside a blue square inside a blue circle
  title = A red triangle inside a blue square inside a blue circle
}

Here is a short description of all the methods provided by `Shape`.

* `empty` creates the empty picture that takes up no space and renders nothing. Useful for that sweet monoid identity and for the base case in recursions.
* `square(sideLength)` creates a square with the given side length.
* `rectangle(width, height)` creates a rectangle with the given width and height.
* `circle(diameter)` creates a circle with the given diameter. Specified in terms of diameter rather than radius so that `square(100)` and `circle(100)` take up the same space.
* `triangle(width, height)` creates an isoceles triangle with the given width and height.


## Implementation

These methods are available on both the `Shape` algebra and `Image`.
